# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start the  program
### Step 2: 
import  math function and assign values of points in two list
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Using the formula display the result 
### Step 5: 
Stop the  program
### PROGRAM:
 ``````

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the python program to find the distance between two points is executed successfully
